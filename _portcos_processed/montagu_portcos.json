The Steam Packet Company had a dominant position in the transportation of passengers and freight to the Isle of Man from ports in the UK underpinned by a long-standing user agreement with the Isle of Man government. The Steam Packet represented a very high quality, secure and cash generative business growing in line with a robust Manx economy. These features made it ideal for a leveraged buyout and as such our success in buying this business was at the end of a fiercely fought private equity auction. In October 2005 Montagu sold the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company to Macquarie Bank.",
